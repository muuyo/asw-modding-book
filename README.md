# Arc System Works Modding Book

 ### hi! i'm muuyo. @WistfulHopes began this documentation project, but due to lack of time I've mostly taken over as the main maintainer (of this fork, shared among the community, which is viewable at https://muuyo.github.io/asw-modding-book/)
the below readme is for posterity.

**Arc System Works fighting games**, specifically those made in Unreal Engine by Team RED, can be heavily modded. From basic texture and model imports all the way to gameplay overhauls and custom characters, these games have a ton of modding potential. However, modding documentation for these games is incredibly lacking. 

Guides for easier mods like texture and model imports are easy to find, but are outdated and lacking critical information. Meanwhile, documentation for editing gameplay scripts is harder to find and split across multiple resources. And there is only one document for custom characters, and it's incredibly lacking. More niche mod types such as UI mods or code mods have zero documentation at all, forcing anyone interested into asking around in Discord servers hoping for answers.

This book aims to fix that. Included within its pages will be thorough information on modding the Team RED games, primarily for the Unreal Engine 4 ones. Most information can be applied to every UE4 game. However, each game has its own quirks, so there will be more specific information in their own categories.

As Guilty Gear Xrd was made in Unreal Engine 3, a vastly different engine from Unreal Engine 4, most general information will not be directly applicable. Pages for it will be added later.
