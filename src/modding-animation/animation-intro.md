This section is all about animations. How to extract, edit and import in the game. To start you need those tools:
- The custom Unreal Engine from [section 1](ue4/getting-unreal.md)
- A copy of Blender
- A copy of Unreal Pak from the [pak section](packing/pack-intro.md)
- HeX editor (I suggest you to use 010 Editor)
- Fmodel from [section 3](tools/fmodel.md)
- AssetEditor from [section 3](tools/asseteditor.md)
