Welcome to the Arc System Works modding wiki!

This is meant to act as a centralized avenue for information gathered by myself and the community as to modding these games. As Arc System Works has modified Unreal Engine for their own purposes heavily, and done many strange deeds in the process of doing so, a wiki has grown increasingly necessary to make everything a bit more digestible and organized.  

This is further compounded by the fact that the tools and avenues for modding are growing old with time; better methods to do things, and methods that have grown less and less useful still being referenced in old video guides. As well, the best bet for many things is to delve into a Discord, and search channels for keywords.

This wiki aims to fix this. I've aimed to format it to be as linearly digestible as I can, with each section laid out in turn.  
Note that Guilty Gear Strive is the modding game of choice for the only editor (muuyo); as such, information on other games is welcome. Please either contribute to [the Github](https://github.com/muuyo/asw-modding-book) or ping me directly for anything quick that would be helpful to add. However, I'm but one man, and my attention is terrible, so I may take a while to get to it. 

*As well, if you really wish to financially support (though completely unnecessary), the profiles linked above have donation links.*
