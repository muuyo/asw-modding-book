In this is section you'll know how to edit Detail/Decal textures and what they are for.
<hr>

## Detail
Detail is a texture that is mapped in the 2ns UV and needed to add small strokes to the model. That's very nice addition and without it models looks unfinished.

## Decal
Decal contains most of the time symbols, texts, and so on. Decal material lays slightly above the main model. Decals are mostly transparent except the text parts.
