In this section you'll know how to extract textures from Guilty Gear STRIVE
<hr>

1. Set up umodel.exe as written in [section 3.2](umodel.md)
2. Navigate to the textures path. It will be Content/Chara/XXX/Costume01/Material/ColorXX. In that image I have selected texture files for Anji for Color01. <div align="center"> <img src="images/Folders.png"> </div>
3. Press "Export" and set the folder, where all exported exported files go and hit OK. <div align="center"> <img src="images/Export-options.png"> </div>
