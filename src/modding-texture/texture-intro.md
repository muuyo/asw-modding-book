# Texture/Colors
*This section is under construction, and was written by @bafrag*

This is probably the main reason why you decided to start modding the game: custom colours. If so, then this section is for you!
<hr>

You will need:
- Umodel from [section 3](tools\get-tools.md)
- The custom Unreal Engine from [section 1](ue4/getting-unreal.md)
- A copy of Blender (highly recommended, but optional)
- A copy of UnrealPak from the [pak section](packing/pak-intro.md)
- Image editing software that works wih .tga files. Either [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) with Alpha to 255 addon. Or Photoshop/[Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)
- This Texture Breakdown you can also read https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ejZ9TrIFNwiawLcFj-XRtaO3Vg9TxD04sR8HKOaRkGI/edit?tab=t.0

I recommend also using the Blender shader to accurately preview what you're doing from [this youtube playlist.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5Bz_3jZMBw&list=PLCkHUM_E60CSi1HowXR3v4uVWNqUDsl9l&index=7), if you want use Blender
