# Creating a .pak archive

## Default

1. In UnrealPak create the folder with your mod name.
2. Inside it create the "RED" folder.
3. In UnrealProject navigate to Saved\Cooked\...\Content folder.
4. Copy the Content folder and paste in "RED" one.

## Mod specific
  - Mesh:
  Don't copy the Skeleton files
  - Animation:
  Don't copy the mesh **files**, but copy the Mesh folder, bc the game refers to this.
