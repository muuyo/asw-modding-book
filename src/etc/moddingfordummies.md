# Modding For Dummies

Hello! As this wiki is decently in-depth and fragmented into different topics due to the nature of things, this is meant to be a "quickstart guide" for anyone stumbling in that doesn't really know where to start. It's *also* fairly in-development, so [contributions are welcome](https://github.com/muuyo/asw-modding-book) - I'll just be slow to merge if they're not to standards (bad grammar or explanations, etc)

If you're looking to *mod the game*, not make mods for it, please see [this page](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/14186).

You most likely want to start with recolors, as they're the most easily graspable, however if you're more a technically inclined / intuitive person like myself you can jump headfirst into model modding - just know that it's a bit of an in-depth topic, and you'll have to do a bit of discord searching.

On that note, here's the Unreal Anime Mods discord: [link.](https://discord.gg/tgFrebr)
 It's obviously a lot less "comprehensive" and structured a place to learn, however realistically you may find yourself having to message search for people with similar issues to you.

 Onto the modding!
 This is all from a Strive modder's perspective, however it should be generally the same as to other games, just with different conventions.

First, you'll need to extract assets from the game. You will most likely want to do this even if you're only making a recolor (to preview your work), but it's not strictly necessary. <br>
There are two tools for this; Umodel and Fmodel. 

[Fmodel](../tools/fmodel.md) is a more modern piece of software, however it lacks the ability to export material names as of present. This generally means getting a model into it requires a bunch more work. As such, I personally use it to browse files and export animations, and then use [umodel](../tools/umodel.md) to export models. 
Next, follow the [mesh importing section](../modding-mesh/mesh-importing.md) if you wish to extract models, or simply navigate to any texture and export them as a TGA otherwise.
