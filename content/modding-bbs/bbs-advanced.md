# Thinking outside the box

<hr>

BBS allows you to do much more than simply change damage numbers and spawn projectiles.

Although it's a bit limited by the very nature of functioning inside of a fighting game framework, you can effectively achieve nearly anything you want with it, as long as you're willing to get creative.

This page serves to highlight a few of these techniques, and lists some examples of what is truly possible with BBS.

## Utilising secondary 'helper' objects

## Changing character moves by only changing CMNEF

## Dynamically altering the move registry

## Examples
  - Stage hazards in DBFZ
  - Lethal League in DBFZ
  - FPS in DBFZ

TODO: Actually make these things publicly available and do small write-ups on them.
