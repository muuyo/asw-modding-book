# Moveset

<hr>

Movesets are defined on a per-character basis in a custom scripting engine developed by Arc System Works. These scripts are called BBScript, but are often abbreviated to **BBS**.

BBS is a very well-documented and understood format, allowing us to not just alter characters, but create entirely new ones as well.

We highly recommend you read [A Sketch of the Arc System Works Engine Script](https://web.archive.org/web/20221115035259/https://pangaea.neocities.org/post/sketch-of-arcsys-scripting/), by Pangaea, first.

For the sake of consistency, all example code uses internal ArcSys nomenclature. Game-specific code might be included where deemed necessary.
