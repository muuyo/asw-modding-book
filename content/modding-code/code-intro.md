Code mods are the "holy grail" of modding in any game. Being able to change how the game works at a fundamental level will always be incredibly powerful. However, such power requires programming experience and intimate knowledge of the game internals. 

Luckily, Guilty Gear -Strive-'s arcade version shipped with debug symbols, which gave tons of insight into how all Team RED games work, and especially cracked open Strive.

Additionally, various breakthroughs in the last year of Unreal modding has made making code mods for UE4/5 games easier than ever. The advent of UE4SS revolutionized code modding for Unreal Engine games, with its ability to create Lua, Blueprint, and C++ mods.

As code modding is such a broad topic, this section expects a basic understanding of how to use C++ and how to use a disassembler. Any disassembler may be used, but this guide will assume the use of Ghidra, as it is the best open source option.
