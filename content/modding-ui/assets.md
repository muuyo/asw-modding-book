# Finding widgets

<hr>

In Team RED Unreal Engine 4 games, all widgets can be found in RED\Content\UI. The overall contents of the folder differ per game, but names are fairly consistent. 

- The HUD for battles can be found in UI\battle in most games. In Strive, it can be found in UI\Battle_Xrd3.
- Widgets with Allset in their names refer to the "master" widget. This widget is the one that's directly displayed, containing all other widgets used for its section.
- Strive tends to postfix its UI folders with Xrd3. This was the codename for Strive during development.

Look inside the folder in the custom project, and try to find the UI element you're looking for. There will be a visual preview of the widget upon opening it. Once you find it, feel free to get creative! Design is incredibly subjective, so I will not provide a tutorial on that. But before you do, make sure to check out the next page, as there are several common pitfalls that could ruin your mod.
